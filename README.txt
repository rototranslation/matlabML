Put all files in one directory and run the main.m file.
In the main.m there are some comments that let you easily understand what's going on.

I suggest to comment the hierarchical clustering part when trying the spectral with
differents values of K because hierarchical is the one that takes most time to compute.

Have a nice day/night/evening!
